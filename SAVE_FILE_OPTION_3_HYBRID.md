## ðŸŽ¯ HYBRID APPROACH OVERVIEW

**Do BOTH in parallel:**
- âœ… **Gmail API pentesting** (5 minutes setup, then runs)
- âœ… **APK building** (20 minutes build time)
- âœ… **Learn Gmail API** while APK builds
- âœ… **Best of both worlds!**

**Timeline:**
```
Minute 1-5:   Get Gmail API credentials
Minute 6-10:  Start Gmail pentesting
Minute 11-30: Build APK (runs in background)
Minute 31+:   Test both Gmail hack AND APK!
```

## ðŸš€ PARALLEL EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Setup Both (5 minutes)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Gmail API setup
cd /home/owner/Github/Fuel\ Book\ Android/gmail-hack
# Get credentials from Google Cloud Console
# Run: python3 gmail_pentester.py

# Terminal 2: APK build setup
cd /home/owner/Github/Fuel\ Book\ Android/fuel-book-mobile
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
eas build:configure
```

### Phase 2: Run Both (20 minutes)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Gmail pentesting (runs in background)
python3 gmail_pentester.py &
# Downloads images while APK builds

# Terminal 2: APK building (takes 20 minutes)
eas build --profile preview --platform android
# Builds APK while Gmail runs
```

### Phase 3: Test Both (10 minutes)
```bash
# Test Gmail results
ls -la /home/owner/Github/Fuel\ Book\ Android/gmail-hack/downloads/
# Should see downloaded images

# Test APK
# Download APK from EAS build link
# Install on phone and test
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ STARTING POINTS

### Option 3A: Start with Gmail API
```bash
# Follow SAVE_FILE_OPTION_1_GMAIL_API.md
# Get credentials, run pentesting
# Then start APK build in parallel
```

### Option 3B: Start with APK Build
```bash
# Follow SAVE_FILE_OPTION_2_APK_BUILD.md
# Start APK build
# Then get Gmail credentials while it builds
```

### Option 3C: Start Both Simultaneously
```bash
# Terminal 1: Gmail API
cd /home/owner/Github/Fuel\ Book\ Android/gmail-hack
python3 gmail_pentester.py &

# Terminal 2: APK Build
cd /home/owner/Github/Fuel\ Book\ Android/fuel-book-mobile
eas build --profile preview --platform android
```
